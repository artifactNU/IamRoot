# Troubleshooting

This directory contains **troubleshooting guides** for diagnosing and resolving common Linux system problems.

The focus is on **systematic problem-solving approaches** and practical diagnostic techniques.

---

## Topics Covered

- **Boot Problems** - System won't start or boots incorrectly
- **Performance Issues** - Slow system, high CPU/memory/disk usage
- **Disk Problems** - Full filesystems, I/O errors, corruption
- **Service Failures** - Services won't start or crash
- **Common Issues** - Frequently encountered problems and solutions

---

## Audience

These guides assume:
- System administration experience
- Understanding of Linux fundamentals
- Familiarity with command-line tools

They do not assume expert-level troubleshooting skills.

## Philosophy

Documentation here should:
- Provide systematic diagnostic approaches
- Explain what to check and why
- Connect symptoms to root causes
- Focus on common, real-world problems
- Include both quick fixes and proper solutions

Troubleshooting is not about memorizing solutions—it's about understanding systems well enough to diagnose new problems.

## When to Use These Guides

- System won't boot
- Performance degradation
- Services failing
- Disk space issues
- Application crashes
- Network connectivity problems
- "System is slow"

The goal is to help you answer: "What's wrong and how do I fix it?"

## General Troubleshooting Approach

1. **Define the problem** - What exactly is broken?
2. **Gather information** - Logs, metrics, error messages
3. **Form hypothesis** - What could cause this?
4. **Test hypothesis** - Check if theory matches evidence
5. **Apply fix** - Resolve the root cause
6. **Verify** - Confirm problem is solved
7. **Document** - Record for future reference

**Don't skip steps.** Jumping to solutions wastes time.
