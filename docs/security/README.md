## Philosophy

Documentation here should:
- Provide actionable security improvements
- Explain why measures matter, not just what to do
- Focus on realistic threats for typical environments
- Balance security with operational needs
- Be implementable by sysadmins, not just security specialists

Security is not about perfection—it's about making attacks more difficult and detecting them faster.

## When to Use These Guides

- Setting up new systems
- Hardening existing infrastructure
- Responding to security incidents
- Conducting security audits
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Implementing compliance requirements

The goal is to help you answer: "Is this system secure enough, and how do I know?"
