# Snippets

This directory contains **short reference material** for common administrative tasks.

Snippets are not full scripts and not long-form documentation, they are quick reminders and examples.

---

## Typical Content

- Bash one-liners
- systemd unit fragments
- SSH command examples
- vim tips
- Common patterns worth remembering

Each topic should live in its own Markdown file.

---

## Guidelines

- Keep snippets concise
- Include brief context where needed
- Prefer examples over explanation
- Avoid environment-specific assumptions

---

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Executable scripts
- Full tutorials
- Generated output
- Configuration files (use `configs/`)

---

## Purpose

Snippets exist to reduce cognitive load during daily operations, quick answers to “how did that go again?”
