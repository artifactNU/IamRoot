# Cheat Sheets

Quick reference guides for common tools and commands.

---

## Purpose

Cheat sheets are **concise operator references** for tools you use often but not often enough to memorize.

They focus on:
- Common commands and patterns
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Quick syntax reminders
- Practical examples

---

## Current Cheat Sheets

- [bash.md](bash.md) - Bash scripting and command-line reference
- [git.md](git.md) - Git version control commands
- [tmux.md](tmux.md) - Terminal multiplexer shortcuts
- [vim.md](vim.md) - Vim editor commands and motions

---

## Guidelines

Cheat sheets should:
- Be scannable and quick to navigate
- Include practical examples over theory
- Use clear section headers
- Focus on what you actually need to look up

If it's a concept that needs explanation, it belongs in `docs/` instead.

## Adding New Cheat Sheets

New cheat sheets should:
- Follow Markdown format
- Include a table of contents for longer references
- Group related commands together
- Provide context where a command might be dangerous
